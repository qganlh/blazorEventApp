Microsoft Copilot is a powerful companion for engineers building Blazor applications.
It accelerates development by offering intelligent code suggestions, generating Razor components, wiring up event handlers, and integrating backend services—all through natural language. 
Whether an engineer is scaffolding a new app or refining an existing one, Copilot can help structure pages, manage state, and connect to APIs with minimal friction.

When it comes to debugging, Copilot can analyze error messages, trace stack traces, and suggest fixes based on best practices and real-world patterns. 
It can simulate user flows, identify lifecycle issues, and recommend performance optimizations tailored to Blazor Server or WebAssembly.
For code reviews, Copilot acts as a second set of eyes—flagging potential bugs, highlighting redundant logic, and offering refactoring tips. 
It can explain complex Razor syntax, compare design patterns, and help enforce architectural consistency across components and services.
In short, Copilot empowers engineers to write cleaner, faster, and more maintainable Blazor apps—while learning and improving along the way.
